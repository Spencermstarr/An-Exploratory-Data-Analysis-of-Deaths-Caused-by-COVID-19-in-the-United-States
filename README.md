# An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Deaths-Caused-by-COVID-19-in-the-United-States
The final project for a graduate level intro to statistical learning and data visualization course which explores the differences in outcomes between countries from Covid-19 by late 2020. Admittedly, and indeed, purposefully, this project was done as an unofficial follow up to the project stores in the Repository called AIT580_Data_Analytics_Project, which can be found here: https://github.com/Spencermstarr/AIT580_Data_Analytics_Project.

#I worked with 5 datasets for this project:
1st - Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Sex, Age, and State from the CDC & NCHS. It contains data on cumulative deaths from COVID-19, total deaths from all causes, Pneumonia deaths, and Influenza deaths in the United States starting at 2/1/20, the beginning of the pandemic’s arrival in this country and going until 11/18/20. The deaths are broken down by sex (male/female), age groups, and state.

2nd - Weekly Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes, 2019-2020 from the CDC & NCHS. It contains data on weekly deaths in the US from all causes including COVID-19 from 1/5/19 until 11/7/20 which is also broken down by state.

3rd - Excess mortality raw death counts from Our World in Data’s article on Excess Mortality. The third dataset contains the raw weekly counts of excess mortality for a multitude of different countries around the world starting on 1/5/20 and going until 10/18/20.

4th - Excess mortality P-scores by age from Our World in Data’s article on Excess Mortality. The fourth dataset has data on the P-scores of excess mortality in the US broken down by age buckets also starting on 1/5/20 and going until 10/18/20.

The 5th and final dataset I used is what Our World in Data calls their “complete COVID-19 dataset” which is updated daily. This is one of the datasets I had already used in the AIT580_Data_Analytics_Project. It has columns for total cases, total tests, total deaths, total cases per million, total tests per million, total deaths per million, new cases, new tests, new deaths, new cases per million, new tests per million, new deaths per million, smoothed versions of all the aforementioned items, and a large host of potential explanatory or predictive factors for most countries worldwide.
